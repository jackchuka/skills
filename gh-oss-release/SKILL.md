# OSS Release

Batch release workflow for multiple OSS repositories using `gh oss-watch releases`.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Check Release Status

Run `gh oss-watch releases` to identify repos with unreleased commits.

If all repos are up to date, report that and stop.

### Step 2: Analyze Unreleased Commits

For each repo needing a release, fetch commit messages since the last tag in parallel:

```bash
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/compare/<last-tag>...HEAD --jq '[.commits[] | .commit.message | split("\n")[0]] | .[]'
```

### Step 3: Recommend Semver Bump

Classify each commit's first line and recommend the highest applicable bump:

| Commit pattern                                          | Bump      |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `deps:`, `deps-dev:`, `ci:`, `chore:`, maintenance-only | **patch** |
| `feat:`, new functionality, non-breaking additions      | **minor** |
| `BREAKING CHANGE`, `!:` suffix, API removals            | **major** |

If ALL commits are deps/ci/chore, recommend **patch**. If any commit adds a feature, recommend **minor**. If any commit has breaking changes, recommend **major**.

### Step 4: Present Recommendations

Present a table for user confirmation:

```
| Repo | Current | Recommended | Commits | Rationale |
|------|---------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| repo-name | v1.2.3 | v1.2.4 | 5 | All dependency bumps |
```

Use AskUserQuestion or wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding.

### Step 5: Create Releases

After confirmation, create releases in parallel:

```bash
gh release create <new-tag> --repo <owner>/<repo> --generate-notes
```

### Step 6: Verify

Run `gh oss-watch releases` again to confirm all repos show "up to date".

### Step 7: Update Homebrew Tap

Ask the user if they want to update the homebrew tap before proceeding. If they decline, stop here.

After confirmation, trigger the scheduled workflow which handles formula updates automatically:

```bash
gh workflow run scheduled.yml --repo jackchuka/homebrew-tap
```

## Important Notes

- **Tag-triggered CI**: Most repos have CI that triggers on tag push (goreleaser, gh-extension-precompile, npm publish). The `gh release create` command creates the tag which triggers the CI build.
- **npm packages with tag-triggered workflows**: These repos derive version from the git tag during CI — no package.json bump needed.
- **Parallel execution**: Fetch commits and create releases in parallel across repos for speed.
- **Never force**: Always confirm with user before creating any releases.
